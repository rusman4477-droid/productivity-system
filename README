# Personal Productivity System (CLI)

A simple command-line productivity tracking system built with **Python** and **SQLite**.
Designed to practice **backend fundamentals**: data validation, persistence, aggregation, and clean program structure.

## Features

* Add daily activities via CLI
* Persistent storage using SQLite
* Input validation (date & duration)
* Daily, weekly, and monthly summaries
* Sorted and limited output for readability
* Modular structure (`main.py` & `db.py`)

## Tech Stack

* Python 3
* SQLite
* Standard Library (`datetime`, `sqlite3`)

## Project Structure

```
.
├── main.py      # CLI logic, validation, summaries
├── db.py        # Database operations (CRUD)
├── productivity.db
└── README.md
```

## How to Run

1. Make sure Python 3 is installed
2. Run the program:

```bash
python main.py
```

3. Use the menu to:

* Add activities
* View summaries
* Exit program

## Why This Project

This project focuses on **system thinking**, not just scripting:

* Clean separation of concerns
* Defensive programming against bad input
* Data aggregation logic commonly used in backend systems

## Future Improvements

* Export reports (CSV)
* Date range filtering
* Basic analytics & insights
